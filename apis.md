description: 'Atma Links is an affiliate marketing technology that helps online publishers
  monetize editorial and user-generated content through contextual affiliate links.
  Atma Links was designed as a user-friendly alternative to traditional in-text advertising.  Rather
  than inserting distracting and, often, irrelevant advertisements into text, Atma
  Links analyzes web content in real-time to identify references to online products
  in plain text.  Unambiguous references are automatically converted to deep affiliate
  links to retail sites which sell the product being linked.  As a supplemental service,
  Atma also automatically attaches affiliate codes to the regular links on a website
  that are eligible for affiliation.  The Atma Links overlay, or pop-up, was built
  to enhance the reading experience by displaying product specific information.  This
  product data includes up-to-date pricing info as well as multiple search options
  for the specific product being linked.  However,  publishers can elect to disable
  this feature and, instead, render the Atma Links presence on content site practically
  invisible.  Hover display is one of many customizable Atma Links features that empower
  publishers to control the in-text advertising on their websites.  With Atma Links,
  publishers also control the volume, display, and relevance of all affiliate links.  For
  product oriented forums, blogs, and web applications, Atma Links delivers significant
  in-text revenue while preserving user experience. '
